# PIMSPythonAssignment
Code for the PIMS Math^Industry workshop Python assignment

As a practice for Python, numpy, pandas and matplot, we were tasked with analyzing an existing data set and creating a short presentation for the rest of the workshop. I looked at primary heating systems and types of energy used throughout Canada, for the years 2013, 2015 and 2017.
